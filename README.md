# 🎮 Unreal Engine Practice Projects

Welcome to my personal collection of Unreal Engine practice projects!  
As a solo game developer learning Unreal Engine, I use this repo to document, track, and share my progress through small game prototypes and experiments.

## 🧠 Purpose

This repository contains individual practice projects to:
- Learn Unreal Engine (Blueprints & C++)
- Explore different game genres and mechanics
- Document my journey as a solo indie dev

## 📁 Project List

- `PingPong/` – A classic pong-style game to learn 2D input, ball physics, and UI.
- `RoadCrossing` - An Arcade-style Road Crossing game featuring grid-based movement, obstacles, collectibles and scoring system.
- More coming soon...

## 🚀 How to Use

Each project folder is a separate Unreal Engine project.  
You can open any project directly with the `.uproject` file inside its folder.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **Unreal Engine 5.x**
- Optional: Visual Studio (for C++ based projects)
